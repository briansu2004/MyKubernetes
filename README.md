kubectl translates your imperative command into a declarative Kubernetes Deployment object.

There are two basic ways to deploy to Kubernetes: imperatively, with the many kubectl commands, or declaratively, by writing manifests and using `kubectl apply`.

How to deploy a database on Kubernetes

Now, letâ€™s dive into more details on how to deploy a database on Kubernetes using StatefulSets. With a StatefulSet, your data can be stored on persistent volumes, decoupling the database application from the persistent storage, so when a pod (such as the database application) is recreated, all the data is still there. Additionally, when a pod is recreated in a StatefulSet, it keeps the same name, so you have a consistent endpoint to connect to. Persistent data and consistent naming are two of the largest benefits of StatefulSets. You can check out the Kubernetes documentation for more details.
